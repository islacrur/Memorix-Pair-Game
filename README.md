# Memorix-Pair-Game

"Memorix" is a web-supported game that involves matching pairs of cards. Upon starting the game, a set of cards will be displayed on the screen. The user manually selects cards, which flip over to reveal the images on them. If the user matches two identical cards, the game continues, adding points to their score; if they don't match, the game ends. If the user completes the game without errors, the score result will be shown on the screen, along with the time taken. Once this point is reached, the user can "Reset the game."

The game features a scoring system and a timer, both of which contribute to the final score. It also offers a difficulty level option for users who enjoy challenging themselves.
